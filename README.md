# Group 1 - Final Project

## Topic Selection, Source & Reasoning

The topic we chose to pursue was wine. The dataset we chose was extracted from Kaggle and contains information about wineries, wine names, years, regions, regional varieties, wine ratings, wine rating counts, wine prices, wine rating to price ratios, vintage ratings, vintage rating counts, vintage prices, vintage rating to price ratios, and age. As wine consumers, we understand that vintage can greatly affect the quality, price, and taste of the finished wine. As data scientists and machine learning practioners, we want to predict whether any of the features has an affect on our vintage rating. 

## Project Outline

### Communication Protocols

We assigned roles and responsibilities early on. We understood our group would be the smallest and therefore decided to maintain our roles throughout the project. Kyle holds the Square role where he is responsible for building the machine learning model and Carolina holds the Triangle & Circle role where she is responsible for establishing and upscaling the database and creating the group presentation and dashboard.  

Our primary line of communication is text messaging and Slack channel. We also utilize our break-out rooms on Monday and Wednesday classes to discuss next steps and exchange ideas.
